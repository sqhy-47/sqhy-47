## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm Angela, an aspiring software engineer and game designer based in New York City.

Iâ€™m passionate about creating interactive experiences and digital solutions that truly engage users. As a student, I've explored game development with GameMaker Language and built web applications using the MERN stack, diving into how technology can craft meaningful user experiences.

Outside of coding and design, I make art, play video games and enjoy working on Rokr mechanical construction kits. 

Let's connect!
